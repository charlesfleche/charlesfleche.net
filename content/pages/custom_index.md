# Hi there, I'm Charles,

a [software developer](https://linkedin.com/in/charlesfleche) from France. I'm making tools for Visual Effects artists, building custom technologies for NGO and coding for Live Entertainment and Projection Mapping.

My last big project has been [Previz](https://previz.co), a real-time 3D content planning and previsualization environment for live entertainment, installations and architectural project. During summer 2018 I've helped my friends from [nexLabs](https://nexlabs.co) in Yangon, Myanmar on a web project as a mentor and frontend developer.

A few years ago I cycled from [France to Australia](http://cambrai-cambrai.net) with [Siugi](http://siugi.com). This has been a crazy trip, but by no mean did it cured my travel bug. Since then I keep on traveling the world for work and fun.

In early 2019 I joined the R&D team of the visual effects studio [Rodeo FX](https://www.rodeofx.com) in Montr√©al, Canada to develop software for their artists.
