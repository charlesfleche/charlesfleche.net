# Hi there, I'm Charles,

a [freelance software developer](https://linkedin.com/in/charlesfleche) from France. I'm making tools for Visual Effects artists, building custom technologies for NGO and coding for Live Entertainment and Projection Mapping.

My last big project has been [Previz](https://previz.co), a real-time 3D content planning and previsualization environment for live entertainment, installations and architectural projects. During summer 2018 I've helped my friends from [nexLabs](https://nexlabs.co) in Yangon, Myanmar on a web project as a mentor and frontend / [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) / [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) developer.

A few years ago I cycled from [France to Australia](http://cambrai-cambrai.net) with [Siugi](http://siugi.com). This has been a crazy trip, but by no mean did it cured my travel bug. Since then I keep on traveling the world for work and fun.

I'm currently back to Cambrai in the North of France where I'm spending the end of the year with my family and work on a web doc with my good artist friends [Ardestop](https://www.facebook.com/ardestop/) and [Damien Nagy](https://www.damiennagy.com/).
