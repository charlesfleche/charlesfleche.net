# Hi there, I'm Charles,

a [software developer](https://linkedin.com/in/charlesfleche) from France. I'm making tools for Visual Effects and Video Games artists, building custom technologies for NGO and coding for Live Entertainment and Projection Mapping.

After years at [The Mill](https://www.themill.com/) and [Disguise](https://www.disguise.one) in London I joined [Télécoms Sans Frontières](https://www.tsfi.org), [Première Urgence Internationale](https://www.premiere-urgence.org) and [Médecins du Monde](https://www.medecinsdumonde.org) to work with medical teams to automate workflows of front line workers in remote Myanmar, Nepal and Syria.

With [Previz](https://previz.co), we made a real-time 3D content planning and previsualization environment for live entertainment, installations and architectural project. During summer 2018 I've helped my friends from [nexLabs](https://nexlabs.co) in Yangon, Myanmar on a web project as a mentor and frontend developer.

A few years ago I cycled from [France to Australia](http://cambrai-cambrai.net) with [Siugi](http://siugi.com). This has been a crazy trip, but by no mean did it cured my travel bug. Since then I keep on traveling the world for work and fun.

In early 2019 I joined the R&D team of the visual effects studio [Rodeo FX](https://www.rodeofx.com) in Montréal, Canada to write [Python](https://python.org) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) pipeline code with [USD](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html) and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) for their artists. I'm now discovering the video games world at [Ubisoft](https://montreal.ubisoft.com).
