Hey, I'm Charles, a [freelance software developer](https://linkedin.com/in/charlesfleche) from France. I'm making tools for Visual Effects artists, heading the tech side of NGO initiatives and coding for Projection Mapping. My current main project is [Previz](https://previz.co), a real-time 3D content planning and previsualization environment for live entertainment, installations and architectural projects.

This blog will document aspects that I find interesting about the projects I've been involved with. Please be in touch by  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlesfleche), [Mastodon](https://mamot.fr/@charlesfleche) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/charlesfleche).

A few years ago I cycled from [France to Australia](http://cambrai-cambrai.net) with [Siugi](http://siugi.com). This has been a crazy trip, but by no mean did it cured my travel bug. Since then I keep on traveling the world for work and fun. I'm currently in [Koh Lanta, Thailand](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=7.5602&mlon=99.0586#map=12/7.5602/99.0586), until mid-December 2017.
