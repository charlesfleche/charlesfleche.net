# Hey, I'm Charles,

a [freelance software developer](https://linkedin.com/in/charlesfleche) from France. I'm making tools for Visual Effects artists, building custom technologies for NGO and coding for Live Entertainment and Projection Mapping.

My current main project for [dandelion+burdock](https://dandelion-burdock.com) is [Previz](https://previz.co), a real-time 3D content planning and previsualization environment for live entertainment, installations and architectural projects.

A few years ago I cycled from [France to Australia](http://cambrai-cambrai.net) with [Siugi](http://siugi.com). This has been a crazy trip, but by no mean did it cured my travel bug. Since then I keep on traveling the world for work and fun. In 2018, after a few months in Berlin, Germany to meet the local tech community, I'm currently helping a local team in Yangon, Myanmar to finish a web application. This month I am working from [Koh Lanta, Thailand](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=7.5602&mlon=99.0586#map=12/7.5602/99.0586) at the [KoHub coworking community](http://kohub.org).
